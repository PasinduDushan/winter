# Advance Heart Rate Monitoring System With A Custom Built Alert System

## Summary

This is my 2nd project proposal because the 1st project proposal only take $100 from the grant and I thought of making another project with the remaining $150. I'll be making an advance heart beat monitoring system which will be a really nice project for me. There are a lot of tutorials out in the internet about making heart beat monitoring systems but mine will be slightly different. As my system will have a custom built alert system which will alert the phone with a notification if the heart beat increases (NodeMCU Module can be used to notify.). Heart Beat will be displayed in a really nice beautiful display with graphs and also this system can be used from anywhere in the world. This project will be really useful for people who have unwell people in the home. 

## Plan

1. Collect all the parts I need to make this project.
2. Check all the parts before getting started. (NodeMCU and TFT Display)
3. Assemble the heart rate sensor and arduino to do a test run to calibrate the sensor. Display won't be a necessary part in this step as I'll be using the serial monitor in Arduino IDE.
4. Assemble the heart rate sensor and TFT display and check whether the display is showing correct data according to the serial monitor.
5. Connect the NodeMCU with the Arduino board.
6. Connect the NodeMCU module with the Mobile Phone.
7. Do a test notification using the NodeMCU.
8. Make a Box out of Cardboard to hold all the parts inside (Expext for the heartbeat sensor.)
9. If everything is working fine assemble all the parts together and do the final checks.
10. Complete the project.

No shipping costs are included because the prices included in the table is very similar to the prices in my local electronic store. I can confirm every item listed here is available in the store and don't need to ship them from overseas.
