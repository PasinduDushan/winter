# Arduino CNC Plotter Machine

## Summary

I'm going to build a arduino CNC plotter machine. This machine will be made with 2 CD/DVD writers, arduino uno board and a motor shileld driver. All the components in the writer will be used in this scenario. Also
I'm going to build a custom made dashboard to convert images to the machine understandable code because it's very hard for someone to do it if a user does not have some 
technical knowledge. 

## Plan

I'm going to make a plan about the items and thing I want before making the project. After that I'm going to de-assemble the DVD writers and remove unnecessary parts from it. 
After that I have to do some wiring with Motor Control Drivers and Arduino board. Next I need to make a pen holder to hold the pen steadily. Then I'll assemble all the parts.
Finally I have to code the machine and then start my work on the dashboard. After doing some final testing I'll marks this project as completed.
